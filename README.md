# Installation and Setup

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these instructions:

## Codes and Resources Used

- **Editor Used:** Visual Studio Code
- **Python Version:** 3.8

## Python Packages Used

- **General Purpose:** `urllib`, `os`, `requests`
- **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`

## Data

### Source Data

- [Dataset Link](https://example.com/dataset): Description of the dataset used for training the chatbot.

### Data Ingestion

Data is collected from APIs and online sources. Follow the instructions in the code to gather the necessary datasets.

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include cleaning, normalizing, and structuring the data for effective training of the chatbot.

## Code Structure

Here's the basic structure of the repository:

```bash
├── data
│   ├── dataset.csv
│   ├── cleaned_data
│   │   └── cleaned_data.csv
├── chatbot.py
├── data_preprocessing.py

└── .gitignore
```
## Result And Evaluation
The chatbot's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Below are the key metrics used to assess the performance:

- **Accuracy:** Measures the overall correctness of the chatbot's responses.
- **Precision:** Indicates the proportion of true positive responses to the total predicted positive responses.
- **Recall:** Represents the proportion of true positive responses to the total actual positive responses.

Visualizations of the results can be included here, such as confusion matrices or bar charts displaying these metrics.

## Future Work
#### Future enhancements could include:

- Expanding the knowledge base to cover more topics and improve response variety.
- Integrating voice recognition features for a more interactive user experience.
- Improving response accuracy through advanced NLP techniques, such as transformer models or fine-tuning existing models.
